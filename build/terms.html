<p class="bold">8. Liability for Transportation Services</p>
	<p class="indent">8.1: You are responsible for the safe packing, loading, securing, and unloading of your belongings. Neither the carrier or ULoad, LLC. is liable for any loss or damage that is caused by your negligence, misconduct or breach of this agreement. ULoad, LLC. is arranging transportation services for you, but is not the actual carrier, and therefore is not liable for the actual transportation services provided. However, ULoad, LLC. will help you attempt to resolve any loss or damage claims that are the carrier's responsibility.
	</p>
	<p class="indent">8.2: By agreeing to the terms of this reservation, you authorize the carrier to deliver the trailer to the origin and destination locations and leave it at the property without you being present. The carrier is liable for physical loss or damage to your property from external causes only while the carrier is transporting your property and subject to the limitation of liability stated herein, but the carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay resulting from your acts or omissions, including without limitation improper packing, loading or unloading or your property, damage to property from environmental conditions (for example, fluctuations in temperature and humidity), or from any acts of god at any time (force majeure). You are required to report all lost or damaged items or other claims to ULoad, LLC. immediately, but no later than nine months after the trailer is delivered to your destination location. ULoad, LLC.'s will relay your claims to the carrier for evaluation and resolution. If the carrier is liable for your claimed damages, the carrier's maximum liability for items lost or damaged is $0.10 per pound per article up to an aggregate maximum of $10,000 per shipment, but in no case to exceed the carrier's liability as listed in the carrier's published tariff. You assume all risk of loss or damage to property or injury to, or death of, persons in or about the trailer arising from any cause whatsoever, except for the carrier's or driver's gross negligence or willful misconduct. You expressly waive all claims (except for the carrier's or driver's gross negligence or willful misconduct), including without limitation subrogation claims against the carrier or driver, and you waive all claims (except for ULoad, LLC.'s gross negligence or willful misconduct) against ULoad, LLC.
	</p>
	<p class="indent">8.3 : ULoad is not responsible for late pickup or delivery of your goods, and therefore, will not be required to pay direct, indirect, or incidental damages arising from your carrier's inability to meet scheduled pickup or delivery times. This is, including, but not limited to: hired labor, travel expenses, airfare, lodging, rent, etc. If you have elected expedited pickup or delivery and your carrier fails to meet these requirements, you will be refunded for costs related to this service accordingly. Due to unforeseeable conditions (e.g., weather, traffic, vehicle complications, driver labor restrictions, etc), you are strongly discouraged from making time-sensitive plans (ex: employment start dates, appointments, etc) or booking travel/lodging that is dependent on your scheduled pickup or delivery times with the carrier. If you are unavailable during pickup or delivery, please arrange for a designated representative to be present.
